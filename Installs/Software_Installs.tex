\section{How to obtain software}
    \paragraph{}
    Here we will go through the steps to install all required software for this workshop. It is presumed that you are working either within a standard Linux terminal, or using \gls{acr:wsl2} from within windows. If you are using any other set up, you will have to find out how to install the required software separately.
