\subsection{Acpype}
    \paragraph{}
    Install acpype using anaconda. In theory this will also install ambertools, however I find that having a separate install for both is best as you have greater control when just using amber.
    \begin{bashcmd}[label=listing:ACPYPEINST]{Commands to install Acpype}
    conda create --name acpype
        y   # proceed with creating the environment
    conda activate acpype
    conda install -c conda-forge acpype
        y   # proceed with installing
    \end{bashcmd}
