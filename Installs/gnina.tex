    Below is the quick way of installing gnina. It simply downloads a pre-compiled binary of the software for an individual to use, however it is strongly recommended that you download the source code and compile it yourself for a more optimised experience.
    \begin{bashcmd}[label=listing:gninaINST]{Commands to install gnina.}
    wget https://github.com/gnina/gnina/releases/download/v1.0.3/gnina
    chmod +x gnina    
    # It is then recommended to add this to your PATH, .bashrc or modules in order to easily run this later in the workshop.
    \end{bashcmd}
